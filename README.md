# Groundwater in Coastal Blocks of Tiruvallur District

## Aim
This study analyzes the behavior of cations and anions in water samples obtained from the coastline regions of Tiruvallur area, Tamil Nadu, India. Thirteen physiochemical characteristics are examined in identically gathered freshwater specimens. 

Key findings include:
- Fifty percent of freshwater tests exceeded the guidelines for water quality for drinking and agriculture.
- Statistical descriptive analysis is employed to understand hydrological features better.
- Hydrochemical patterns are assessed using graphical plots such as Piper, Wilcox, and Gibbs:
  - **Piper Plot**: Indicates that high sodium concentrations stimulate cation exchange between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the soil.
  - **Gibbs Plot**: Indicates anthropogenic activities dominate evaporation.
  - **Wilcox Plot**: Shows groundwater is suitable for agriculture.
- The cation concentration is notably higher in the eastern section of the chosen area.

The study highlights the need for appropriate treatment of groundwater for drinking and agricultural applications, addressing saline water invasion, rock-water interaction, and irrigation flows.
